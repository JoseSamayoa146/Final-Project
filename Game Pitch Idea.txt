Game idea: I wanna create a game where the main character has to go thrpugh several levels without touching an enemy or else he loses a life each time

Characters Action/Goal: To make it to the end in order to win

Characters: Just a man and a bunch of obstacles in order to win

Win/Lose: If he makes it to the end then the user wins, if he loses 3 lives the game finishes.

Progression Levels: Each level gets harder and harder, you have very easy, easy, medium, hard, very hard

Sources: Super Mario Bros

Skills: Someone that can help and move the world when the character moves, someone that can keep track of the score with a scoreboard,
somone that can design how the obstacles move.
